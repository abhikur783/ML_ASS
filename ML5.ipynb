    "\n",
    "Example Scenario: In a customer segmentation project for an e-commerce company, we have a categorical feature \"Preferred Product\n",

    "    A3. Nominal encoding is preferred over one-hot encoding in situations where:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Limited Resources: When dealing with a large number of categorical features or categories, one-hot encoding can result in a \n",
    "    high-dimensional and sparse dataset, requiring substantial memory and computational resources. Nominal encoding, on the ot-\n",
    "    her hand, reduces the dimensionality to a single numerical column.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Non-Ordinal Categories: When the categorical data does not have an inherent order or ranking, nominal encoding is more app-\n",
    "    ropriate. One-hot encoding introduces artificial ordinality, which might mislead certain algorithms.\n",

    "Example Scenario: Consider a dataset for movie recommendations, where the feature \"Genre\" includes various categories like \"Act-\n",

    "3. Handling Multiple Categories: Animals can belong to various species, habitats, and have diverse diets. One-hot encoding all-\n",
    "    ows for the representation of multiple categories per data point without any ambiguity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: If an animal belongs to species \"Lion,\" habitat \"Savannah,\" and diet \"Carnivore,\" one-hot encoding would create binary \n",
