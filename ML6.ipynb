    "Q1. What is the difference between Ordinal Encoding and Label Encoding? Provide an example of when you\n",

    "Ans:\n",
    "    Ordinal Encoding and Label Encoding are both methods used to convert categorical data into numerical format, but they are \n",
    "    used in different scenarios:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.Label Encoding:\n",
    "   - Label Encoding assigns a unique integer value to each category in the categorical variable.\n",
    "   - It is typically used for nominal data, where the order of categories is not meaningful.\n",
    "   - Example: Encoding colors \"Red,\" \"Green,\" and \"Blue\" as 0, 1, and 2.\n",
    "\n",
    "2 Ordinal Encoding:\n",
    "   - Ordinal Encoding assigns integer values to categories based on their inherent order or ranking.\n",
    "   - It is used for ordinal data, where the order of categories matters.\n",
    "   - Example: Encoding education levels \"High School,\" \"Bachelor's,\" \"Master's,\" and \"Ph.D.\" as 1, 2, 3, and 4.\n",
    "\n",
    "When to choose one over the other:\n",
    "- Use  Label Encoding when dealing with nominal data, and the order of categories doesn't have any significance.\n",
    "- Use Ordinal Encoding when working with ordinal data, where the order or ranking of categories is meaningful and should be\n",
    "preserved in the encoding.\n",
    "\n",
    "Keep in mind that the choice between these encoding methods depends on the specific characteristics of the data and the requir-\n",
    "ements of the machine learning algorithm being used. Some algorithms might be sensitive to the ordinal nature of the encoded va-\n",

    "Q2. Explain how Target Guided Ordinal Encoding works and provide an example of when you might use it in\n",
    "a machine learning project.\n",
    "Ans:\n",
    "    Target Guided Ordinal Encoding is a special type of ordinal encoding that takes into account the target variable to assign \n",
    "    numerical values to categories. It is typically used when the target variable is ordinal, and the encoding aims to\n",
    "    capture the relationship between the categorical variable and the target variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's how Target Guided Ordinal Encoding works:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.Compute the Mean or Median of the Target Variable: For each category in the categorical variable, calculate the mean or \n",
    "    median value of the target variable. This gives an indication of how the target variable varies with each category.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.Order Categories based on Mean or Median: Sort the categories in ascending or descending order of their mean or median \n",
    "    values from step 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.Assign Ordinal Ranks Assign integer values (ordinal ranks) to the sorted categories based on their order, starting from 1\n",
    "    , 2, 3, and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.Replace Categories with Ordinal Ranks: Replace the original categorical values with the assigned ordinal ranks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: Suppose we have a dataset with a \"Temperature\" feature (Cold, Warm, Hot) and a target variable \"Comfort Level\"(Low,\n",
    "            Medium, High). We want to encode \"Temperature\" using Target Guided Ordinal Encoding.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Calculate the mean or median comfort level for each temperature category:\n",
    "   - Cold: Low\n",
    "   - Warm: Medium\n",
    "   - Hot: High\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Order the temperature categories based on their comfort level mean or median:\n",
    "   - Cold (Low)\n",
    "   - Warm (Medium)\n",
    "   - Hot (High)\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Assign ordinal ranks to the ordered temperature categories:\n",
    "   - Cold: 1\n",
    "   - Warm: 2\n",
    "   - Hot: 3\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Replace the original temperature values with their assigned ordinal ranks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Use Case: Target Guided Ordinal Encoding is useful when dealing with ordinal categorical features and an ordinal target variable\n",
    "    . It can be applied in projects where the relationship between the ordinal feature and the target is crucial for the machine\n",
    "    learning model's performance. For example, when predicting customer satisfaction levels (Low, Medium, High) based different\n",
    "    product ratings (Poor, Fair, Good, Excellent), Target Guided Ordinal Encoding can help capture the ordinal nature of the \n",
    "    feature and its impact on the target variable."
